A furious tapping/swiping game with upgradable gloves and objects to punch and destroy. 
Tapping and swiping in different directions have different punching moves. 
The more you destroy or go through objects, you earn points, and the enemies gain more health exponentially, making the game endless.
Separate to this, you can unlock new objects to punch new gloves to buy (with varying effects and damage values). 
When you have reached a certain point limit, you can unlock an option to upload your own image to punch. 
There is also a count for how many things you have destroyed, so that you can compare with friends!
